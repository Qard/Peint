# Peint

This is a complete rewrite of Peint. As such, it is currently in alpha stage, so expect bugs and/or instability.

## Sample

To view the sample, the repo must be hosted with a static server. Then go to /sample/index.html to view the sample.

## Documentation

Same as with the sample, host the repo with a static server. Then go to /docs/peint.html to view the docs.

## Custom Builds

For information on custom builds, run `./build -h`. Note though, that `Peint.all()` is not yet setup to handle custom builds and thus will fail.
